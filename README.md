switch_sim
==========
This is a dumb L1 switch simulator, written in Python/Django.  It supports a few (most basic) L1 switch operations, such as
* listing the ports
* listing the port mappings
* map 2 ports
* unmap 2 ports
* clear all port mappings

It also has a few basic managment operations, such as 
* get a list of simulated switches
* for a particular switch, show me the details
* for a particular switch, add/delete a bunch of ports
